# Differences in population estimates - OWID based on UN vs US Census Bureau

This dataset was calculated by OWID based on population estimates from the UN Population Division (2017) and US Census Bureau.

Absolute differences measure the absolute difference in regional and global population estimates from the UN Population Division and US Census Bureau. Figures were calculated as the annual total population estimate from the UN Population Division (2017) minus population estimates from the US Census Bureau.

Relative differences measure this difference in estimates as a percentage of UN figures (i.e. (UN population - US Census Bureau population) / UN population).

Negative figures therefore represent lower UN estimates vs. US Census Bureau estimates, and vice versa (positive values indicate higher UN estimates).
