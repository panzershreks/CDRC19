# Public expenditure on health in the long run - Lindert (1994), OECD, WHO

Lindert acknowledges difficulties in reconstructing health expenditure data for such old period due to data availability and definitions, and admits that a degree of subjectivity if inevitable. A full discussion on these issue is in Lindert (1994), pp.7-8.

He adopts a definition of Public expenditure on health based on OECD, Social Expenditure 1960-1990, (1985), where it is defined as: 'Expenditure on hospitals, clinics and medical, dental and para-medical practitioners, public health, medicaments, prostheses, medical equipment and applicance or other prescribed health-related products, and applied research and experimental development related to health and medical delivery systems' (p.75).

According to Annex C of OECD (1985), further information are available "in the 'Instructions and Definitions' which accompany the Government Expenditure Questionnaire completed by Member governments, the response to which provides the basis of the government expenditure accounts included in OECD National Accounts".
