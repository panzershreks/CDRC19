# Child deaths by life stage (OWID based on UN IGME)

Data represents the total number of deaths of children (under 5 years old) by life stage. 

This is split into three categories: 
- the first 28 days of life; 
- 29 days to 1 year; 
- 1-4 years.

This was calculated by Our World in Data based on data on neonatal, infant and under-5 deaths published by the World Bank (based on the UN IGME).

- The first 28 days of life are equally to neonatal deaths;
- 29 days to 1 year are calculated as infant minus neonatal deaths;
- 1-4 years calculated as under-5s minus infant deaths.
