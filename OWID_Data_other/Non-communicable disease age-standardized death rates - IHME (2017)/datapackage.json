  "description": "The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database reports the age-standardized death rates by cause and risk factors for any given year.\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand the distinction between risk factors and causes of deaths. Causes of deaths are defined by the OECD as: \"the underlying cause of death refers to the disease or injury that initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death or the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the injury.\" Causes of deaths therefore include particular events such as road accidents, natural disasters, drowning, HIV/AIDS, and non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, and various cancers.\r\n\r\nData here relates to the age-standardized death rates from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) - that is, the cause of death rather than particular risk factors which may increase the likelihood of NCDs. Age-standardized death rates correct for differences in population size by reporting the number of deaths per 100,000 people, and the age of the population by assuming a constant age distribution in line with a reference population. \r\n",
