# Outdoor air pollution deaths (IHME, 2019)

Data on total outdoor (ambient) air pollution deaths and death rates were calculated by Our World in Data based on two metrics published by the IHME, Global Burden of Disease study.

Total outdoor air pollution deaths are given as the sum of 'Ambient ozone pollution deaths' and 'Ambient particulate matter pollution deaths'. The same applies to the calculate of total outdoor pollution rates.
