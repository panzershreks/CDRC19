# Healthy Life Expectancy - IHME

Data on 'Healthy Life Expectancy' and 'Life Expectancy' are provided by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), Global Burden of Disease. This is measured based on expectancy of a newborn born in the given year.

Our World in Data have calculated the number of years of living with a disability as the difference between total and healthy life expectancy.
