This includes an update of the underlying country-level data. You can find details here: http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/whatIsNew.aspx\r\n\r\nMethodology.\r\nPovcalNet allows calculating different poverty lines using 2011 PPPs for several reference years (1981, 1984, 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013).\r\nWe calculated different poverty lines to define the consumption groups. For example, consumption group 1.25 - 1.9 is calculated as follows: 'total population living under the poverty line at 1.9 int-$ per day' minus 'total population living under the poverty line at 1.25 int-$ per day'. \r\n\r\nUnderlying source data.\r\nConsumption per capita is the preferred welfare indicator for the World Bank’s analysis of global poverty. But not all national statistical agencies report to the World Bank consistent estimates of consumption based on expenditure surveys. For about 25% of the countries, estimates correspond to income, rather than consumption.",
