  "description": "Temperature anomalies are based on the HadCRUT4 land-sea dataset as published by the Met Office Hadley Centre. Temperature anomalies are given in degrees celcius relative to the average temperature over the period 1961-1990. These are available at the global level, for the Northern Hemisphere, South Hemisphere, and Tropics (defined as 30 degree north and south of the equator).\n\nThe median temperature anomaly, as well as the upper and lower bound anomalies (with a 95% confidence interval) are provided.\n\nFull details of the source of this dataset is available in the following paper:\nMorice, C. P., J. J. Kennedy, N. A. Rayner, and P. D. Jones (2012), Quantifying uncertainties in global and regional temperature change using an ensemble of observational estimates: The HadCRUT4 dataset, J.
