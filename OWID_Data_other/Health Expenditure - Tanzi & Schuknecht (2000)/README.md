# Health Expenditure - Tanzi & Schuknecht (2000)

Authors note that years for estimates are approximated to closest estimate available. Data for 1880 is taken from Lindert, Peter H. "The rise of social spending, 1880-1930." Explorations in Economic History 31, no. 1 (1994): 1-37. This one of the sources used by Tanzi & Schuknecht (2000) for 1910 and 1930.

Data for health insurance coverage comes from "Flora, Peter, Franz Kraus, and Winfried Pfennig, 1983 and 1987. State, Economy and Society in Western Europe, 1815-1975, Vol. 1,1983, Vol. II, 1987 (Chicago: St. James Press)."
