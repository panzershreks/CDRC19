# Youth Mortality Rate - UN IGME (2018)

Youth Mortality Rate measures the share of newborns who die before reaching the age of 15. 

This dataset was constructed by Our World in Data based on data from the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME).

We define and calculate 'youth mortality' based on the combination of:
- under-5 mortality rates (the share of newborns who die before reaching the age of five)
-  5-14 mortality rates (the share of children aged 5 who die before reaching the age of 15).

Both of these metrics are available from the UN IGME. Based on these estimates we calculate 'youth mortality': the share of newborns who die before reaching the age of 15.
