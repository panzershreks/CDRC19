Introduction

Motivation and Background

Data collection
  - data sources

Covid-19 death rate response variables

Missing Data (summary statistics)
  - Category A
  - Category B

imputation
  - about imputation
  - random forest imputation and correlation (VIF)
    - why this imputation method, using GVIF for factor variables etc.
    - category A
    - category B
  - other imputation methods (MICE, pmm, cart)

model selection
  - stepwise selection, forward? backward? AIC? BIC?
    - category A
    - category B

robustness?
  - combining significant categories
  - imputing using these categories
  - model comparison
  - robustness discussion

final model
  - properly write out model
  - model checking
    - epsilon are independent
    - epsilon have constant variance
    - epsilon are normally distributed (not very important)

results
  - summary statistics
  - discussion

further investigation
  - noscomial infections
  - bayesian?
  - further results

conclusion
  - possible further avenues of research/investigation
