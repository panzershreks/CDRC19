## Report Structure Section 6 & 7

### Chapter 6 - Model Selection

What do we want to include?

* How did we select our model (VIF Theory)
* How did we select our model (Stepwise selection theory)
* discuss linear modelling (theory)
* discuss how we used linear miodelling and why they didn't work (i.e. show assumption plots and explain) (pretend we just did this with one imputed dataset then we scrapped it)
* Theory of GLM (including explaining Gamma with loglink)
* Three Models and how the imputation worked and at what stage what stage it was done.
* Discuss GLM model assumptions


### Chapter 7 - Model Robustness

What do we want to include?


* (2nd) Random Forest Method of Imputation (firslty discuss briefly how it worked and then go onto discuss the model assumption plots)
* Bootstrapping (theory of bootstrapping and discuss the bootstrapping results)


### Chapter 8 - Final Model Results

* include variables and p-values and significance of each model (all 6) and the output
* plot of fitted v.s actual for some bits

### Chapter 9 - Final Model Discussion

* discussion of variables
