# Under 5 mortality rate [Our World in Data]

We have combined two sources: The UN Child Mortality Estimates (CME) data and the Human Mortality Database (HMD).

All data points from the CME used. HMD has been used as a supplement when CME data is not available for a given year. HMD values are multiplied by factor of 1.1 for Belarus, Hungary and Lithuania (to match CME data as described in Hill et al. 2012). HMD values are multiplied by a factor of 1.2 for Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Latvia, Russia, Slovakia, Spain and Estonia (before 1992) (to match CME as described in Hill et al. 2012).

Hill et al. 2012 adjust the CME data by these same factors because of concerns about the low levels of early neonatal death recorded in the civil registration systems of these countries compared to western European countries as a result of differences in the definition of live births.
