# Causes of infant death in boys and girls (IHME, 2018)

Rates of infant mortality by sex for selected causes of death. This is based on death rates per 100,000 for infants less than one year old. This is given for a range of leading causes of death for comparison between infant mortality rates in males and females.

For conciseness and clarity, we have shortened a few of the original IHME causes of death:
Congenital birth defects = Birth defects
Congenital heart anomalies = Heart anomalies
Digestive congenital anomalies = Digestive anomalies
Neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma = Encephalopathy from asphyxia and trauma
Neonatal preterm birth = Preterm birth
