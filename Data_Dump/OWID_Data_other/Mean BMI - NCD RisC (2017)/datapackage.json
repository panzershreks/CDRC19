  "description": "This dataset presents the mean Body Mass Index (BMI) by country, region, and globally for men and women.\n\nBody Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by his or her height in meters squared (m2). The WHO define a BMI <=18.5 as 'underweight'; 18.5 to <25 as 'normal/healthy'; 25.0 to <30 as 'overweight'; and >30.0 as 'obese'.\n\nThe data was sourced from 2,416 population-based studies with measurements of height and weight on 97.4 million participants aged 20 years and older.\n\nNCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) is a network of health scientists around the world that provides rigorous and timely data on risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) for 200 countries and territories. The group works closely with the World Health Organisation (WHO), through the WHO Collaborating Centre on NCD Surveillance and Epidemiology at Imperial College London. NCD-RisC pools high-quality population-based data using advanced statistical methods, designed specifically for analysing NCD risk factors. The Collaboration currently has data from over 2,000 population-based surveys from 189 countries since 1957, with nearly 25 million participants whose risk factor levels have been measured.",
