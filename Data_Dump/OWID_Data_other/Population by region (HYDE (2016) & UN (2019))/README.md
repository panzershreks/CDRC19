# Population by region (HYDE (2016) & UN (2019))

This long-run population series by region was constructed by Our World in Data based on two key sources: the HYDE database (2016) and UN World Population Prospects (2019). 

- HYDE (2016) data is used from the year -10,000 to 1940
- UN World Population Population Prospects (2019) from 1950 to 2019; 
- Projections to 2100 from the UN World Population Population Prospects (2019)

HYDE regions have been aggregated to match with UN regional groupings:
- 'Europe' and 'CIS' in HYDE data have been combined and labelled here simply as 'Europe'
- 'Asia' and 'Middle East' in HYDE data have been combined and labelled here simply as 'Asia'
