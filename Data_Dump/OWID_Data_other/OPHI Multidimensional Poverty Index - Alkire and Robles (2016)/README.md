# OPHI Multidimensional Poverty Index - Alkire and Robles (2016)

Definitions

People are considered 'multidimensional poor' if they are deprived in at least one third of the weighted indicators.

The ten indicators relate to: Years of Schooling, Child School Attendance, Child Mortality, Nutrition, Electricity, Sanitation, Drinking Water, Floor, Cooking Fuel, Asset Ownership. The first four of these indicators carry a weight of one sixth each (i.e. 0.166). The other six have a weight of one eighteenth each (i.e. 0.055)

Survey data

Years correspond to the year reported for the underlying survey used as source in each country. Whenever surveys correspond to year intervals (e.g. 2011-2012), we display the end year for that interval.

The source notes that "The global MPI was first released in 2010, for 104 developing countries, and has been updated yearly with the latest data available. Starting from winter 2014/2015, updates are now made twice a year, in summer and winter. In June 2015, the Global MPI was updated for 32 countries and 6 new countries have been added to the list of those last reported in 2014. In total it now covers 101 developing countries, using data ranging from 2005 to 2014."
