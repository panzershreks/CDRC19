# Life expectancy & population - Gapminder (2019), UN (2019), and Our World In Data (2019)

This dataset presents estimates of the expectancy and population by country for 1800, 1950, 2015, and 2019.

For life expectancy in 1800, we use data from version 9 of Gapminder, the latest as of 2019, which is based on 100 sources compiled by Mattias Lindgren. (https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd004/)

For life expectancy in 1950, 2015, and 2019, we use data published by the United Nations Population Division. (https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Metadata/Documentation/)

For population, we use Our World in Data's population dataset, from our page on World Population Growth, which was constructed by Our World in Data based on the HYDE database (2016) and UN's World Population Prospects (2019).
