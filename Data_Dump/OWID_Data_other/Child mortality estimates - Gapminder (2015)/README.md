# Child mortality estimates - Gapminder (2015)

This is Version 8 of the data set uploaded by Gapminder on 2015 October 18
 
 
The World series for 1800 to 1960 was calculated by Max Roser on the basis of the Gapminder estimates of child mortality and the Gapminder series on population by country. For each estimate in that period a population weighted global average was calculated.
The recent annual observations of the World series (1960 and later) is taken from the World Bank (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT).
