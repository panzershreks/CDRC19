This was based on data across both sexes in adults aged 18+ years old.\n\nThe ratio of diabetes prevalence to overweight was derived in the same way, but using the share of adults with a BMI of 25 or over (which is defined as 'overweight'). \n\nObesity and overweight prevalence data was sourced from: http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.home\nDiabetes prevalence data was sourced from: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators",
