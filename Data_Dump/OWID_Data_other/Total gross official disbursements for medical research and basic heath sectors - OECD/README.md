# Total gross official disbursements for medical research and basic heath sectors - OECD

The sum of Official Development Assistance (ODA) flows from all donors to developing countries for medical research and basic health.

ODA: The DAC defines ODA as â€œthose flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients
and to multilateral institutions which are:
i) provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive
agencies; and
ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and is concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated at a rate of discount of 10 per cent).

Medical research and basic health sectors are as defined by the DAC. Medical research refers to CRS
sector code 12182 and basic health covers all codes in the 122 series (see here: http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm).
