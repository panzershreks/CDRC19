# Chartbook of Economic Inequality, Gini (2016)

Please note that for some countries the Chartbook includes additional time series for economic inequality.

The purpose of the Chartbook is to present consistent time-series for each country over time. Unfortunately there are important cases in which the comparability between countries is limited. The table below lists the definition of the Gini time series for each country and differences in definitions should be taken into account when making cross-country comparisons.

The addition of series x behind the definition indicates that there are several Gini time-series available for this country in the Chartbook and they can be found at the country page there.
