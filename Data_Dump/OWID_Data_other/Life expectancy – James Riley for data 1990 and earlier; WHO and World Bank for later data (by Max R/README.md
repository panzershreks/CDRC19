# Life expectancy â€“ James Riley for data 1990 and earlier; WHO and World Bank for later data (by Max Roser)

Changes to Riley's data by Max Roser:

I have assigned the 'Life expectancy before health transition' from Riley's data to the year 1770 for all world regions. The reason for doing this is that 1770 is the earliest available data from his paper and I chose that as the start year for the chart.

Then I took Riley's estimate for 'Period when earliest health transition in region began' and assigned the 'Life expectancy before health transition' to the mid-point of that period.

From then on I show Riley's data until 1990 where his dataset ends.



For 2000 and later estimates:

Africa: WHO for world region 'Africa'

Americas: WHO for world region 'Americas'

Asia: World Bank population weighted average of all countries in Riley's definition of Asia http://www.lifetable.de/cgi-bin/countryR.plx?c=Asia
