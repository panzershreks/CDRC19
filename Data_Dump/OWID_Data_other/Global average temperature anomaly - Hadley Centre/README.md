# Global average temperature anomaly - Hadley Centre

The temperature anomaly is measured relative to the 1961-1990 global average temperature. Temperatures at this baseline represent an increase of 0.3-0.4 degrees celcius since pre-Industrial (1850) global average temperatures.

The data presented here is a combined land-surface air temperature and sea-surface temperature series. Upper and lower bounds represent the 95% confidence intervals.
