Temperatures at this baseline represent an increase of 0.3-0.4 degrees celcius since pre-Industrial (1850) global average temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe data presented here is a combined land-surface air temperature and sea-surface temperature series. Upper and lower bounds represent the 95% confidence intervals.",
