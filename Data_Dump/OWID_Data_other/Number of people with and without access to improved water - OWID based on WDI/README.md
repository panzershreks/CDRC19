# Number of people with and without access to improved water - OWID based on WDI

The absolute number of people with and without access to an improved water source has been calculated by OurWorldinData based on data of the share of the population with access, and the total population: both of these datasets sourced from the World Bank, World Development Indicators.

The World Bank note that an improved water drinking source: "includes piped water on premises (piped household water connection located inside the userâ€™s dwelling, plot or yard), and other improved drinking water sources (public taps or standpipes, tube wells or boreholes, protected dug wells, protected springs, and rainwater collection)."
