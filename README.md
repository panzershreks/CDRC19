### Project description

This project will involve finding publically available data on Covid-19 death rates (per 100 thousand people) for different countries, along side variables that may be associated with the differences in death rate, such as health system spending, hospital cross infection rates, GDP, economic inequality, extend of suppression measures undertaken etc. 

The assembled data set will then be analysed using statistical regression methods in R, to investigate the strength and statistical significance of any apparent associations.

A couple of example data sources are https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/
